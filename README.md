<!--            Thermostat Software -->
# Backstory:
You've just been employed by a leading thermostat manufacturer. Your first task? To develop the software for a thermostat aimed at elderly homes. It's crucial that the temperature remains between 20-25 degrees Celsius to ensure the comfort and safety of the residents.

# Objective:
Write a Python program that simulates the thermostat's functionality. The program should:
- check the temp
- If the temp is outside the 20-25 degrees range, adjust it to bring it within range.
- Continuously monitor and adjust the temperature until condition is met

# Task:
- Use a while loop to keep checking and adjusting the temperature.
- If the temperature is below 20 degrees, increment the temperature 
- If the temperature is above 25 degrees, decrement the temperature
- If the temperature is within range, print: "GOOD! Temperature is within comfort range."

# Hints:
- Use multiple while loops, one to check if temp is too low and the other to check if the temp is too high
